Hey! welcome to PASTA.
quick reminder that since PASTA is completely anonymous,
you MUST keep your user-hash and 2FA key at all costs.
There is no recovery method in case they are lost.

How do I use the 2FA key?
Great question! you must open an authenticator app
such as "Google Authenticator",
then, add via setup key, you may give the account whatever
name you want. make sure it is "time based".
when you finish, you will get a 6 digit code that switches
every few seconds,
that is your 2FA! use that when signing in.
